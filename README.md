# Data Analysis Task

## Techstacks 
1. Frontend:
React: Used for building the frontend user interface.
React Hooks: Used for state management and side effects.
ReactDOM: Used for rendering React components to the DOM.
React Strict Mode: Enabled for strict mode checks during development.
CSS: Used for styling the components and layouts.
Flexbox: Used for flexible and responsive layouts.
Media Queries: Used for responsive design for different screen sizes.
Mantine: Utilized MantineProvider for styling components.

2. Backend/Data Processing:
JavaScript/TypeScript: Used for backend logic and data processing.
Node.js: Possibly used for server-side logic (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from React and data processing code).
Fetch API: Used for making asynchronous requests to fetch data from the server.
JSON Data: Used for storing and processing data, fetched and processed using JavaScript/TypeScript.

3. Data Handling/Processing:
TypeScript Interfaces: Defined interfaces for structured data handling.
Data Fetching: Used to fetch data from an external source, possibly an API or JSON file.
Data Processing: Processed fetched data using custom functions for aggregation and average calculation.

4. Other Tools/Dependencies: 
React Strict Mode: Used for enhanced development checks and warnings.
React-Bootstrap: Possibly used for styling components and layouts (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from the project structure).
Webpack/Babel: Likely used for bundling and transpiling JavaScript/TypeScript code.
ESLint: Possibly used for code linting and enforcing code quality standards.
Prettier: Possibly used for code formatting and style consistency.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
